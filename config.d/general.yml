cfg:
  # The route server AS number.
  rs_as: 999

  # The route server's router ID.
  #
  # This can be set using a single router ID or a list
  # of multiple router IDs. If multiple values are provided,
  # then a single execution of ARouteServer will generate
  # multiple configurations, one for each router ID, all
  # having the same characteristics, but just a different
  # value for the "router ID" setting of the target BGP
  # daemon.
  #
  # More details on the Configuration page on ReadTheDocs:
  # https://arouteserver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/CONFIG.html

    next_hop:

      #   routes received from a route server client matches the
      #   interface address of the client."
      # - 'same-as': permit next-hop rewriting for the same AS; this
      #   "allows an organization with multiple connections into an
      #   IXP configured with different IP addresses to direct traffic
      #   off the IXP infrastructure through any of their connections
      #   for traffic engineering or other purposes."
      #   In this mode, all the IP addresses of clients that fall
      #   under the same ASN will be allowed. This is limited to the
      #   IP addresses of known clients configured in the 'clients.yml'
      #   file.
      # - 'authorized_addresses': check that the BGP NEXT_HOP attribute
      #   for routes received from a route server client matches one
      #   of the IP addresses reported in the client-specific
      #   'authorized_addresses_list' option.
      #   This allows a route server client to announce routes whose
      #   NEXT_HOP attribute is the IP address of a non-client router.
      #   The 'authorized_addresses_list' option must be configured

  rpki_roas:
    # This section is used to configure how RPKI ROAs are gathered
    # when 'filtering.irrdb.use_rpki_roas_as_route_objects' or
    # 'filtering.rpki_bgp_origin_validation' are enabled.

    # The source used to gather RPKI ROAs.
    #
    # Can be one of the following options:
    # - 'rtr': ROAs are loaded from an external RTR source.
    #   rtrllib (https://github.com/rtrlib/bird-rtrlib-cli) can be
    #   used for BIRD 1.6.x; in BIRD v2, v3 and OpenBGPD there is
    #   built-in support for the RTR protocol.
    #   The name of the table where send the ROAs to is 'RPKI' for
    #   BIRD 1.6.x and 'RPKI4' and 'RPKI6' for BIRD v2 and v3.
    #   When the built-in implementation is used for OpenBGPD
    #   or BIRD v2/v3, an external file 'rpki_rtr_config.local' must be
    #   found within the same directory where the main configuration
    #   file is stored (/etc/bird or /etc/bgpd usually) and must
    #   contain the configuration of the RTR sessions specific for
    #   that daemon.
    #   An example on how to setup that file can be found in the
    #   examples/rpki_rtr directory (please note, in order to use
    #   the RTR protocol BIRD must be compiled with --enable-libssh).
    # - 'ripe-rpki-validator-cache': ROAs are loaded from a JSON
    #   file in RIPE NCC RPKI Validator cache format.
    #
    #   Known compatible implementations at time of writing:
    #   - RIPE NCC RPKI Validator: https://www.ripe.net

  blackhole_filtering:
    # Destination-based blackholing policy: if a policy is given,
    # accept prefixes of any length if they are tagged with the
    # 'blackholing' BGP community and if they are "covered by an
    # equal or shorter prefix that the neighboring network is
    # authorized to advertise."
    # (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7999#section-3.3).

    # How to treat prefixes subject to blackhole filtering.
    #
    # If no policy is provided here then blackhole filtering is
    # not implemented in the route server.
    #
    # Options:
    # - 'propagate-unchanged': the route is accepted and propagated
    #   to clients unchanged. If missing, the BLACKHOLE well-known
    #   community 65535:666 is added. Other local 'blackholing'
    #   communities are scrubbed.
    #   It's up to the receiving client to accept the route and to
    #   discard traffic toward its prefix.
    # - 'rewrite-next-hop': same behaviour of 'propagate-unchanged'
    #   option; in addition, the route server rewrites the NEXT_HOP
    #   attribute of the advertised route with the address of the
    #   blackhole next-hop (BN). BN should have a unique MAC
    #   address determined by ARP/NDP used to filter L2 frames
    #   entering clients ports on the basis of their destination
    #   MAC address.
    #
    # Default: none
    #policy_ipv4:
    #policy_ipv6:

    # IP addresses of BN used for 'rewrite-next-hop' option:
    #
    # Default: none
    #rewrite_next_hop_ipv4: "192.0.2.66"
    #rewrite_next_hop_ipv6: "2001:db8::66"

    # How tagged routes should be propagated to clients.
    # This configuration statement works together with the same
    # client-level 'blackhole_filtering.announce_to_client' option.
    # If here 'announce_to_client' is True, tagged routes
    # are announced to clients unless they have their
    # 'announce_to_client' option explicitly set to False.
    # If here 'announce_to_client' is False, tagged routes
    # are announced to clients only if they have the
    # 'announce_to_client' option explicitly set to True.
    #
    # Can be overwritten on a client-by-client basis.
    #
    # Default: True
    announce_to_client: True

    # Automatically add the NO_EXPORT well-known community to
    # tagged routes before announcing them to clients.
    #add_noexport: True

  graceful_shutdown:
    # Graceful BGP session shutdown (gshut) can be configured here.
    # When 'enabled' is True, the route server processes the routes
    # that are tagged with the GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN BGP community
    # (65535:0) accordingly to draft-ietf-grow-bgp-gshut, that is
    # it lowers their LOCAL_PREF to the value set in 'local_pref'.
    # (https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-grow-bgp-gshut-11)

    # Enable processing of GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN BGP community.
    #
    # If 'enabled' is False in the general.yml configuration then
    # routes tagged with the GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN BGP community are
    # treated transparently; the gshut community is not stripped
    # off.
    #
    # If 'enabled' is True in the general.yml configuration but
    # False on a specific client configuration then routes tagged
    # with the GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN BGP community received from that
    # client will be treated as if the gshut community was missing
    # and the community stripped off.

    # Can be overwritten on a client-by-client basis.
    #
    # Default: False
    enabled: False

    # Value used to set the new LOCAL_PREF attribute of routes
    # processed accordingly to gshut.
    # Meaningful only when 'enabled' is True.
    #
    # Default: 0
    local_pref: 0

  rfc1997_wellknown_communities:
    # RFC1997 well-known communities (NO_EXPORT and NO_ADVERTISE)
    # can be locally interpreted or passed through the route server,
    # depending on the policy that a route server operator decides
    # to implement.
    # This section allows to configure this policy.

    # The policy used to process routes tagged with NO_EXPORT or
    # NO_ADVERTISE that are received from clients.
    #
    # Options:
    # - 'rfc1997': routes are processed accordingly to RFC1997;
    # - 'pass': routes are propagated to other clients with the
    #   NO_EXPORT/NO_ADVERTISE communities unaltered.
    #
    # Default: pass
    policy: "pass"

  # Thresholds used for actions that are performed on the basis
  # of clients RTT, triggered using RTT-based BGP communities.
  #
  # Used only if one or more of those BGP communities are set.
  #
  # The value in the last part of the community identifies the
  # threshold for which the action is requested; only values from
  # the 'rtt_thresholds' are taken into account and actually used
  # to understand if the desired action should be performed.
  #
  # Lower-than actions are inclusive, higher-than are exclusive.
  #
  # Some examples (based on the default values below):
  #
  # - 15, lower-than: action is performed for peers with RTT <= 15
  # - 30, higher-than: action is performed for peers with RTT > 30

    # This section can be used to map reject codes to specific
    # BGP communities, without following the general pattern
    # imposed in 'reject_cause'. It can be used only when the
    # 'reject_policy' option is set to 'tag' or 'tag_and_reject'.
    #
    # The 'reject_cause_map' does not replace the use of
    # 'reject_cause': the BGP communities configured in this
    # map are added to those built according to 'reject_cause'.
    # When a route is rejected, in order to determine the
    # BGP community to be attached to it to describe the reject
    # reason, a lookup is performed in this table for the reject
    # code: if an entry is found, the community mapped to that
    # reject code is attached to the route, in addition to the
    # BGP community formatted according to 'reject_cause'.
    #
    # To configure this section, values from the official list
    # of reject codes must be used as the key of the dictionary.
    #
    # The 'rs_as' macro can be used here.

    #     "14":
    #       lrg: rs_as:1101:13
    #
    # In the example, 14 is the reject code for RPKI INVALID routes
