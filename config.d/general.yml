    next_hop:
      # The 'policy' option can be set using the following values:
      # - 'strict': "check that the BGP NEXT_HOP attribute for BGP
      #   routes received from a route server client matches the
      #   interface address of the client."
      # - 'same-as': permit next-hop rewriting for the same AS; this
      #   "allows an organization with multiple connections into an
      #   IXP configured with different IP addresses to direct traffic
      #   off the IXP infrastructure through any of their connections
      #   for traffic engineering or other purposes."
      #   In this mode, all the IP addresses of clients that fall
      #   under the same ASN will be allowed. This is limited to the
      #   IP addresses of known clients configured in the 'clients.yml'
      #   file.
      # - 'authorized_addresses': check that the BGP NEXT_HOP attribute
      #   for routes received from a route server client matches one
      #   of the IP addresses reported in the client-specific
      #   'authorized_addresses_list' option.
      #   This allows a route server client to announce routes whose
      #   NEXT_HOP attribute is the IP address of a non-client router.

    # The source used to gather RPKI ROAs.

    #   rtrllib (https://github.com/rtrlib/bird-rtrlib-cli) can be

    #   BIRD 1.6.x and 'RPKI4' and 'RPKI6' for BIRD v2.
    #   In BIRD v2, an external file 'rpki_rtr_config.local' must be
    #   found within the same directory where the main configuration
    #   file is stored (/etc/bird usually) and must contain the BIRD 2

    #   setup that file can be found in the examples/bird2_rpki_rtr
    #   directory (please note, in order to use the RTR protocol BIRD
    #   must be compiled with --enable-libssh).

  blackhole_filtering:
    # Destination-based blackholing policy: if a policy is given,
    # accept prefixes of any length if they are tagged with the
    # 'blackholing' BGP community and if they are "covered by an
    # equal or shorter prefix that the neighboring network is
    # authorized to advertise."
    # (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7999#section-3.3).

    # How to treat prefixes subject to blackhole filtering.
    #
    # If no policy is provided here then blackhole filtering is
    # not implemented in the route server.
    #
    # Options:
    # - 'propagate-unchanged': the route is accepted and propagated
    #   to clients unchanged. If missing, the BLACKHOLE well-known
    #   community 65535:666 is added. Other local 'blackholing'
    #   communities are scrubbed.
    #   It's up to the receiving client to accept the route and to
    #   discard traffic toward its prefix.
    # - 'rewrite-next-hop': same behaviour of 'propagate-unchanged'
    #   option; in addition, the route server rewrites the NEXT_HOP
    #   attribute of the advertised route with the address of the
    #   blackhole next-hop (BN). BN should have a unique MAC
    #   address determined by ARP/NDP used to filter L2 frames
    #   entering clients ports on the basis of their destination
    #   MAC address.
    #
    # OpenBGPD: there is an issue that prevents the 'rewrite-next-hop'
    # option to work for IPv6 on versions prior to OpenBSD 6.1.
    # https://github.com/pierky/arouteserver/issues/3
    #
    # Default: none
    #policy_ipv4:
    #policy_ipv6:

    # IP addresses of BN used for 'rewrite-next-hop' option:
    #
    # Default: none
    #rewrite_next_hop_ipv4: "192.0.2.66"
    #rewrite_next_hop_ipv6: "2001:db8::66"

    # How tagged routes should be propagated to clients.
    # This configuration statement works together with the same
    # client-level 'blackhole_filtering.announce_to_client' option.
    # If here 'announce_to_client' is True, tagged routes
    # are announced to clients unless they have their
    # 'announce_to_client' option explicitly set to False.
    # If here 'announce_to_client' is False, tagged routes
    # are announced to clients only if they have the
    # 'announce_to_client' option explicitly set to True.
    #
    # Can be overwritten on a client-by-client basis.
    #

    # tagged routes before announcing them to clients.
    #add_noexport: True

  graceful_shutdown:
    # Graceful BGP session shutdown (gshut) can be configured here.
    # When 'enabled' is True, the route server processes the routes
    # that are tagged with the GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN BGP community
    # (65535:0) accordingly to draft-ietf-grow-bgp-gshut, that is
    # it lowers their LOCAL_PREF to the value set in 'local_pref'.
    # (https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-grow-bgp-gshut-11)

    # Enable processing of GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN BGP community.
    #
    # If 'enabled' is False in the general.yml configuration then
    # routes tagged with the GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN BGP community are
    # treated transparently; the gshut community is not stripped
    # off.
    #
    # If 'enabled' is True in the general.yml configuration but
    # False on a specific client configuration then routes tagged
    # with the GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN BGP community received from that
    # client will be treated as if the gshut community was missing
    # and the community stripped off.
    #
    # OpenBGPD: GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN BGP community is not implemented
    # on versions prior to 6.2.

    # Can be overwritten on a client-by-client basis.
    #
    # Default: False
    enabled: False

    # Value used to set the new LOCAL_PREF attribute of routes
    # processed accordingly to gshut.
    # Meaningful only when 'enabled' is True.
    #
    # Default: 0
    local_pref: 0

  rfc1997_wellknown_communities:
    # RFC1997 well-known communities (NO_EXPORT and NO_ADVERTISE)
    # can be locally interpreted or passed through the route server,
    # depending on the policy that a route server operator decides
    # to implement.
    # This section allows to configure this policy.

    # The policy used to process routes tagged with NO_EXPORT or
    # NO_ADVERTISE that are received from clients.
    #
    # Options:
    # - 'rfc1997': routes are processed accordingly to RFC1997;
    # - 'pass': routes are propagated to other clients with the
    #   NO_EXPORT/NO_ADVERTISE communities unaltered.
    #
    # Default: pass
    policy: "pass"

  # Thresholds used for actions that are performed on the basis
  # of clients RTT, triggered using RTT-based BGP communities.
  #
  # Used only if one or more of those BGP communities are set.
  #
  # The value in the last part of the community identifies the
  # threshold for which the action is requested; only values from
  # the 'rtt_thresholds' are taken into account and actually used
  # to understand if the desired action should be performed.
  #
  # Lower-than actions are inclusive, higher-than are exclusive.
  #
  # Some examples (based on the default values below):
  #
  # - 15, lower-than: action is performed for peers with RTT <= 15
  # - 30, higher-than: action is performed for peers with RTT > 30
  # - 1000, not in 'rtt_thresholds', action not performed
  # - 0, not in 'rtt_thresholds', action not performed
  #
  # The values must be provided in ascending order.

    # OpenBGPD: large communities are not supported on versions prior
