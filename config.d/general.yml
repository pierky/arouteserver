    #
    # If no policy is provided here then blackhole filtering is
    # not implemented in the route server.
    #
    # Options:
    # - propagate-unchanged: the prefix is accepted and propagated
    #   to clients unchanged. If missing, the BLACKHOLE well-known
    #   community 65535:666 is added. Other local 'blackholing'
    #   communities are scrubbed.
    #   It's up to the receiving client to accept the prefix and to
    #   discard traffic toward it.
    # - rewrite-next-hop: same behaviour of 'propagate-unchanged'
    #   option; in addition, the route server rewrites the NEXT_HOP
    #   attribute of the advertised prefix to the address of the
    #   blackhole next-hop (BN). BN should have a unique MAC
    #   address determined by ARP/NDP used to filter L2 frames
