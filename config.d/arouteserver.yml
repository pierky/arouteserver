# Path to the 'bgpq3' external program.
# Going against the Principle of least astonishment,
# the value of this configuration line can also
# be set to the path of the 'bgpq4' program.

# Host running IRRD software used by bgpq3/bgpq4.
# (-h argument).
# Use "host:port" to specify alternate port.
# Please note: to use rr.ntt.net at least bgpq3 0.1.35

# Path to the program used to determine the RTT of peers.
#
# An example is provided within the config directory and
# can be used by setting rtt_getter_path to "rtt_getter.sh".
#
# Syntax and details can be found at the following URL:
# https://arouteserver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/RTT_GETTER.html
#rtt_getter_path:

# How many threads will be used to acquire data from
# external sources (IRRDB info, PeeringDB for max-prefix
# limit).
#threads: 4

# Cache expiry time, in seconds.
#
# This can be a single integer value or a list of 'keyword: value'
# pairs. If a single value is provided here, it will be used as
# the expiry time for every kind of resource used by the program;
# otherwise, each resource will use its own expiry time (or the
# 'general' one if its specific expiry time is not given).
#
# Resources are identified by the following keywords:
#
# pdb_info: info fetched from PeeringDB (AS-SETs that networks
#       configured in their IRR Record field, IPv4 and IPv6
#       prefix count).
#
# ripe_rpki_roas: RPKI ROAs fetched from the RIPE RPKI Validator.
#       See the 'general.yml' configuration file comments for more
#       details.
#
# irr_as_sets: ASNs and routes fetched from IRR using clients'
#       AS-SETs.
#
# Please note: if the desired behavior is to completely bypass
# cache it is advisable to avoid setting expiry time to zero but
# rather to set it to a duration that is enough to cover the whole
# configuration processing time. During the configuration building
# process some resources may be used more than once; a value of
# zero would require them to be fetched multiple time during the
# same execution.
#
# Single value:
#cache_expiry: 43200
#
# Multiple values (default):
#cache_expiry:
#  general: 43200
#  pdb_info: 86400
#  ripe_rpki_roas: 43200
#  irr_as_sets: 43200
#  arin_whois_db_dump: 43200

# Enable automatic checking for new release.
# When set to True, the program automatically checks PyPI for
# a new release; if found, it logs a warning message.
