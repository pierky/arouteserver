    #
    # If the client's configuration does not provide any AS-SET
    # and prefixes/origin enforcing is used then the following
    # AS-SETs are used.
    #
    # Example:
    #   asns:
    #     AS1:
    #       as_sets:
    #         - "AS-AS1"
    #     AS2:
    #       as_sets:
    #         - "AS-AS2"
    #   clients:
    #     - asn: 1
    #       ip: "192.0.2.11"
    #       cfg:
    #         filtering:
    #           rpsl:
    #             as_sets:
    #               - "AS-AS1-CUSTOMERS"
    #    - asn: 2
    #      ip: "192.0.2.22"
    #
    # This configuration leads to:
    # - AS-AS1-CUSTOMERS to be used for AS1 client, because client
    #   level 'as_sets' has higher priority over AS-level;
    # - AS-AS2 to be used for AS2 client, because no 'as_sets' are
    #   given for that client.
