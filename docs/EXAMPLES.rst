Examples of configurations
==========================

Default
-------

Configurations built using the default ``general.yml`` and ``clients.yml`` files distributed with the project.

https://github.com/pierky/arouteserver/blob/master/examples/default

See the `textual representation (HTML) of this configuration <_static/examples_default.html>`__.

Feature-rich example
--------------------

Configurations built using the files provided in the ``examples/rich`` directory.

- GTSM and ADD-PATH are enabled by default on the route server.
- Next-hop filtering allows clients to set NEXT_HOP of any client in the same AS.
- Local networks are filtered, and also transit-free ASNs, "never via route-servers" networks, invalid paths and prefixes/origin ASNs which are not authorized by clients' AS-SETs (which are fetched from PeeringDB).
- Dataset used for prefix validation extended using NIC.BR Whois DB dump and RPKI ROAs.
- RPKI-based Origin Validation is enabled; INVALID routes are rejected.
- RFC9234 route leak prevention using roles is configured.
- A max-prefix limit is enforced on the basis of PeeringDB information.
- Blackhole filtering is implemented with a rewrite-next-hop policy and can be triggered with BGP communities BLACKHOLE, 65534:0 and 999:666:0.
- Control communities allow selective announcement control and prepending, also on the basis of peers RTT.
- 32bit ASNs are mapped to 16bit ASNs for usage in standard BGP communities.
- Graceful BGP session shutdown is enabled.
- Client timers are configured using the custom, site-specific .local file.
- Informational custom BGP communities are used to tag routes from European or American clients.

Please note: for the sake of readability of the configuration files built in this example the set of RPKI ROAs is artificially limited to just a bunch of them.

BIRD hooks example
------------------

The BIRD configurations provided in this example have been generated enabling `BIRD hooks <https://arouteserver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/CONFIG.html#site-specific-custom-config>`_:

.. code-block:: console

   $ arouteserver bird --ip-ver 4 --use-local-files header --use-hooks pre_receive_from_client post_receive_from_client [...]

The above list of hooks passed to the ``bird`` command has been truncated for the sake of readability; the complete list used in this example is provided below.

The command line argument ``--use-local-files`` enables the ``header`` inclusion point, in order to add the ``include "/etc/bird/header.local";`` configuration statement to the BIRD configuration generated by ARouteServer.

.. code-block:: none
   :emphasize-lines: 11

   define rs_as = 999;
   
   log "/var/log/bird.log" all;
   log syslog all;
   debug protocols all;
   
   protocol device {};
   
   table master sorted;
   
   include "/etc/bird/header.local";
   ...

This file must be present on the route server where BIRD is executed and must contain the custom functions used to implement the hooks. See the ``header.local`` file for the functions declaration.

List of hooks used in this example:

- pre_receive_from_client
- post_receive_from_client
- pre_announce_to_client
- post_announce_to_client
- scrub_communities_in
- scrub_communities_out
- apply_blackhole_filtering_policy
- route_can_be_announced_to
- announce_rpki_invalid_to_client

Clients from Euro-IX member list JSON file
------------------------------------------

Some clients files automatically built from `Euro-IX member list JSON files <https://github.com/euro-ix/json-schemas>`_ are reported here.

``configure`` command output
----------------------------

The ``configure`` command can be used to quickly generate policy definition files (*general.yml*) which are based on suggested settings and best practices.

A list of BGP communities is also automatically built.

.. code-block:: console

   $ arouteserver configure --output examples/auto-config/bird-general.yml
   
   BGP daemon
   ==========
   
   Depending on the BGP daemon used for the route server some features may not be
   available.
   
   Details here:
   https://arouteserver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/CONFIG.html#caveats-and-
   limitations
   
   Which BGP daemon will be used? [bird/openbgpd] bird
   Which version? [1.6.3/1.6.4/1.6.6/1.6.7/1.6.8/2.0.7/2.0.7+b962967e/2.0.8/2.0.9/2.0.10/2.0.11/2.13/2.14/2.15/3.0] 2.15
   
   Router server's ASN
   ===================
   
   What's the ASN of the route server? 64496
   
   Route server's BGP router-id
   ============================
   
   Please enter the route server BGP router-id: 192.0.2.1
   
   List of local networks
   ======================
   
   A list of local IPv4/IPv6 networks must be provided here: routes announced by
   route server clients for these prefixes will be filtered out.
   
   Please enter a comma-separated list of local networks: 192.0.2.0/24,2001:db8::/32
   
   
   
   Route server policy definition file generated successfully!
   ===========================================================
   
   The content of the general configuration file will now be written to
   examples/auto-config/bird-general.yml
   
   Some notes:
   
    - Accepted prefix lengths are 8-24 for IPv4 and 12-48 for IPv6.
    - Routes with 'transit-free networks' or 'never via route-server' (PeeringDB)
   ASNs in the middle of AS_PATH are rejected.
    - IRR-based filters are enabled; prefixes that are more specific of those
   registered are accepted.
    - PeeringDB is used to fetch AS-SETs for those clients that are not explicitly
   configured.
    - RPKI ROAs are used as if they were route objects to further enrich IRR data.
    - NIC.BR Whois database dump is fetched from Registro.br to further enrich IRR
   data.
    - RPKI BGP Origin Validation is enabled. INVALID routes are rejected.
    - PeeringDB is used to fetch networks prefix count.
    - Route leak prevention using roles (RFC9234) is enabled.
    - Routes tagged with the GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN well-known community (65535:0) are
   processed accordingly to draft-ietf-grow-bgp-gshut.
   
The textual description (HTML and Markdown) generated on the basis of the *general.yml* files produced by this command is also reported here.

IX-F Member Export files

The files reported within this directory were generated using the ``ixf-member-export`` `command <https://arouteserver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/USAGE.html#ixf-member-export-command>`__.

BIRD v2/v3 and OpenBGPD RPKI RTR configuration
----------------------------------------------

This is an example of how to use BIRD v2/v3 or OpenBGPD with an external source for RPKI ROAs based on the RTR protocol.

BIRD v2/v3 and OpenBGPD (starting with release 6.9) have built-in support for the RTR protocol, that allows to connect the BGP daemon directly to a local cache (a "validator").

To configure the daemons with ARouteServer in order to fetch ROAs using RTR, the ``rpki_roas.source`` option must be set to ``rtr`` and a local *rpki_rtr_config.local* file must be placed inside the same directory where the main configuration file is created (*/etc/bird* or */etc/bgpd* by default, or a custom one set using the ``--local-files-dir`` command line argument of ARouteServer).

The *rpki_rtr_config.local* file is expected to contain the snippet of BIRD or OpenBGPD config needed to setup one or more RTR sessions:

- BIRD v2/v3: https://bird.network.cz/?get_doc&v=20&f=bird-6.html#ss6.13

  **Please note:** the names of the tables where ROAs will be injected into must be ``RPKI4`` and ``RPKI6``.

- OpenBGPD: https://man.openbsd.org/bgpd.conf#rtr

Example configurations are reported in the *rpki_rtr_config.local.BIRD* and *rpki_rtr_config.local.OpenBGPD* files that can be found within this directory.
